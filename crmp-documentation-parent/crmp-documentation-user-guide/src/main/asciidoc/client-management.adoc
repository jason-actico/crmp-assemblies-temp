:cm-clientDataManagement: Client & Facility Data Management
[[cm-clientDataManagement,{cm-clientDataManagement}]]
= {cm-clientDataManagement}

The CLI Module supports the import of existing client master data from third party applications, e.g. core banking / client management systems. All data can also be entered manually using an intuitive web-based front-end. This includes both master data for clients as well as relationship data for managing groups of related companies.

In addition, facility and collateral data can be fed into the system to establish related risk rating and credit origination processes. The Client Management Module is seamlessly integrated with the platformâ€™s other credit risk management modules. This includes the financial spreading and calculation of a risk rating on both an individual company level and an aggregated group level.

:importClientExternalSource: Import a client from an external source
==  {importClientExternalSource}
Instead of manually creating a client in the system it is also possible to import it from 3rd party systems using a configurable interface. Once the interface is set up, clients and client relationships can be imported.

Typical sources of master data records are:

* SAP
* Salesforce
* Master Data Database

=== Automatic Update
CRMP allows third party applications to automatically create and update client master data and client relationship (group) information using a set of webservices provided by the system. See the technical design document for more information. 


=== Manual import of client and group master data
1. Open Menu *Client - Import from External System*
+
image::Client_FacilityManagement/1100_MenuImportClient.png[{width50},align=center]

2. Search for the client record in the third party system by client name or External Client ID
+
NOTE: Search capabilities and criteria are dependent on the connected third party system
+
image::Client_FacilityManagement/1200_ImportClientSearch.png[{width75},align=center]

3. Navigate through the provided search results and press *Select* to import the select client and client group structure
+
A duplicate check against the provided external Client ID is performed. If the client already exists in the CRMO the coresponding client is shown and a notification message is displayed.
+
image::Client_FacilityManagement/1300_ImportClientSuccess.png[{width75},align=center]

4. Review the imported client information

:cm-manual-update-external-client: Manual update of client and group master data from external sources
[[cm-manualUpdateExternalClient, {cm-manual-update-external-client}]]
=== {cm-manual-update-external-client}

1. Search for an existing client as described in section <<cm-searchClient>>
2. In the overview section press the button *Refresh Client Data from External System*
+
image::Client_FacilityManagement/1400_UpdateExtClientManually.png[{width75},align=center]

=== Maintain client and group master data
In CRMP, the client is considered the starting point for all business processes (e.g. financial spreading or risk rating).

The identification and maintenance of client information therefore is a crucial part and can be divided into the following steps:

* Search and select clients
* Maintain client and group master data
* View client history

CRMP supports those activities as described in the following sections.  

:cm-search-client: Search clients
[[cm-searchClient,{cm-search-client}]]

The entered search criteria will be AND combined. This means that the returned search criteria have to match all provided input.
+
image::Client_FacilityManagement/1700_SearchClientResults.png[{width75},align=center]
+
NOTE: Text fields such as name, street or postcode allow usage of * as a wildcard at the beginning or the end of the search term.
+
3. To export the search results, press button *Export Results*. An Excel file containing the data visible in the *Search Results* section is made available for download
4. Click on the *Internal Client ID* to open the client details
