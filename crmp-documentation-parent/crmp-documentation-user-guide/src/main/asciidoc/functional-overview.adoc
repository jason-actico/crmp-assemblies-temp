= Functional Overview

The Credit Risk Management Platform (CRMP) is a robust and scalable software solution for credit risk management. The platform is used by banks, financial service providers and corporations for assessing and managing credit risks.
Core features of the platform include *capturing and spreading financial statements* as well as a flexible framework for the **implementation of internal rating models**. Based on *internal risk ratings* and **externally sourced credit information**, the platform enables the implementation of **strategies for credit origination and automated decisioning**. A simulation environment allows users to analyze the effecs of changes to the underlying risk models and sustainably optimize the models.

The following diagram depicts the main functional modules of the Credit Risk Management Platform:
